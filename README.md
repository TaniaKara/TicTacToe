Also, the following additional tasks were completed and added to the project: 

Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
